    "## Jupyter Notebook Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter stands for 'Julia', 'Python', and 'R', which are three programming languages. Notebooks allow for visual explaination of programs that can include graphics, text, code and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of cells we will be using:\n",
    "    - Markdown cells: Cells that can include text, images, tables and anything a word document can contain.\n",
    "    - Code Cells: cells that have code in them and can be executed by the user\n",
    "    - Output cells: if your code cell creates output to the notebook, it will be contained in an output cell.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: The default type of cell is a code cell. At the top of the Jupyter Notebook, there is a dropdown arrow that allows you to change the cell type to 'Markdown' from 'Code' (below the Widget's menu)\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Markdown Cells:\n",
    "Markdown cells can be just text, but there are also include graphics, tables, pictures, equations and formatted text\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>This is bold text </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Italic Text </i>\n",

    "\n",
    "To edit the markdown cell, you need to double click on the cell\n",
    "##### Code Cells:\n",
    "Not surprisingly, code cells have code in them! The rows in a code cell are also numbered and there is an \"In []\" on the far left. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to put a comment in a code cell, start that row with # and python will ignore the line\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output Cells:\n",
    "Output cells magically appear below a code cell if the code creates output to be printed. Code cells that have an variable or object as the last line (versus a command) will also produce an output cell with this object being printed.\n",

    "Good question. For a Jupyter Notebook to be able to show output and rerun cells, it has to have a program running in the back that stores all of the information. This is called a kernel. (No idea why, but it is. Not sure if it is after a popcorn kernel or the unit of truth.)\n",
    "\n",
    "OK. I looked it up it is after the Old English word for 'seed', meaning this is where everything grows from.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you step through a notebook making code changes, the kernal keeps track of everything. It also numbers the code cells and output cells that have been run. (See the #1 in the code cell and output cell above)\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells are run one at a time (usually), so order matters in a program. If you make a mistake that changes your data to something you don't want, you need a way to reset everything. This is called resetting the kernal.\n",
    "To do this, you select 'Kernel' from the menu bar and usually select 'restart and clear all output'. This will make all of the values you entered disappear until you rerun the code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you select this now, it will remove the # on our code cell above and remove the output cell completely.\n",
    "\n",
