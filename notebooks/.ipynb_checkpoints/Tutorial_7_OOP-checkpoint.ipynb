    "# Object Oriented Code \n",
    "We have already been introduced to objects in python. Lists are objects, strings are objects, dataframes are objects and almost everything in python is a object. So what is an object exactly? \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects of the same type have the same methods available to them and the same list of attributes, even through the attributes themselves are different. For example, let's consider a pandas dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODS:\n",
    "    - head() will work on any dataframe because head is a method of the broader thing (a class) that is a dataframe\n",
    "    - describe() will work on any dataframe\n",
    "    - value_counts() on any column of a dataframe works because the columns are part of a broader thing, a series.\n",
    "\n",
    "ATTRIBUTES\n",
    "    - shape will return the shape of any dataframe (even if it is empty)\n",
    "    - index will return the index of any dataframe\n",
    "    - columns will return all of the columns of the dataframe\n",
    "    \n",
    "These methods and attributes are common to all dataframes because they are defined in the dataframe class. A class defines which attributes the object has and what methods you can perform on that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will start with a basic description of a class, explain how to create attributes (properties) and methods (object specific functions) of the class and how to create (instantiate) an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a basic, easy to understand example and then build examples more relevant to Treasury. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "Structuring similar data in classes is called 'Object-Oriented Programming' (OOP). It is just a way to group observations from your data into categories based on how similar they are and what you will need to do with them in a program. It is really not more complicated than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that OOP allows you to leverage your code so that it can be reused by you or anyone else. In fact, people can use you classes without having to know the details of how they are created or how the methods actually work. This is extremely valuable and if you think about the tutorials we have completed, we do this all the time. When we are running df.value_counts() did we dig into the code about how this methods works? No, we just used it. When we merged two dataframes together, did we cover the programming required in the df.merge() command? No, we just used it. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Long Term Goal of OOP\n",
    "The goal here is to have us develop well defined classes, such that anyone can use our classes without having to know how the methods work. The best example of this would be a Monte Carlo simulation of 3 different exchange rates. If we have a class that has a .simulate() method, then all we need to know is how to create the object and interact with the methods. (Meaning, what are the input variables and what will this method return.) We don't need to know how the stochastic calculus works inside the method."
